          <h2>Movie Theaters Are Looking Post Apocalyptic...</h2>
          <p class="description">
            In times like these, the Covid-19 virus has made restrictions on all aspects of our lives for every person in the world. Yet, one activity may take a turn for the worst even after the virus clears up: Movies.

          <h2>Professionalism and Social Media</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Social media and professionalism: mutually exclusive or one and the same? On this episode of the Cheetah's podcast, we talk all things social media as it relates to professionalism in the workplace. How has the line changed between what is appropriate and what is not if we are sharing our lives on the internet? Should our employers have a say in what we post? How has the dawning and explosive growth of the internet age changed this perception? Listen up to hear our thoughts!

          <p class="description">
            Let's paint! Come get inspired with me!

            I pull out all my old dusty paint supplies that have been sitting in my closet for the past year over this hazy pandemic period. I hope with this video to not only inspire myself to pick up my painting hobby again but to encourage anyone who has maybe fallen out of a hobby recently or to even inspire you to start something new. Like oil painting!

            Enjoy my scenic mountain cottage painting full of all my cottagecore dreams and fantasies.
